# M375T-Experimental-Mathematics-IPD-Report
Final project code for Iterated Prisoners Dilemma Project - M375T Experimental Mathematics.

# Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: Strategy Evolution and Memory Depth

This project simulates the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) using various strategies across multiple generations, focusing on the effects of memory depth and strategic adaptation. It was created as part of a final report for an Experimental Mathematics course and is designed to be both an educational tool and a platform for further experimentation.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Implement classic and custom IPD strategies (e.g., Tit for Tat, Grim Trigger, Random, Always Cooperate/Defect)
- Simulate tournaments with and without mutation across generations
- Visualize the evolution of strategy fitness over time
- Explore the effect of increasing memory complexity on the number of possible strategies

## 🧠 Core Features

- Custom IPD simulation engine
- Modular design for creating and testing new strategies
- Evolutionary simulation of strategy success over generations
- Visualizations for strategy prevalence and memory-space growth

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- MemoryLengths.py: visualizes growth in different strategies
- StrategiesAndPayoff.py: visualizes payoff and payoff variance
- Cooperation1.1.py: visualizes payoff and cooperation average with various memories


## 📈 Sample Visualizations

Plots from the simulations include but are not limited to:

- Growth of Pure Strategy Space with Memory Length
- Strategy Distribution Over Generations
- Cooperation rate Trends Over Generations
- Performance of Memory Strategies Over Generations
- Average Payoff vs Memory Size
- Average Payoff Over Generations
- Payoff Variance Over Generations

> For visuals, see the final report or generate your own by running the scripts.
